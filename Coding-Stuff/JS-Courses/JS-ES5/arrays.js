var favFood = ["roti", "chips", "pie", "custard"];

for (var i = 0; i < favFood.length; i++) {
	
document.write (favFood [i]);
document.write ("<br>");
}
	
	

/* the variable i has the vaule off 0. So if i is less then the lenght of favfoods array then i++. This means increment the value off i by 1. ++ means plus 1.  Once this code is completed the for loop is completed*/
